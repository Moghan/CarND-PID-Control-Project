Description of effect from P, I and D components.

P: Increasing P makes the steering angle change more, in proportion to CTE. With to low P, the car can not cope with sharpe curves. To high P throws the car off the road.

I: I assumed no systematic bias exists and set it to zero. 

D: Counter overshooting. It dont behave like I expected. I probably set D very high. There is no smoothness to it. Feels like it kick in during one timespace which make it zero in the timespace after.


Manually tuned the parameters for a couple of hours.
